# Mentee handbook

The mentoring programme is designed to upskill potential candidates to
take on maintainer and other formal roles, as well as offering support
and guidance longer term. It is also designed to help improve and grow
the Astropy community – both in terms of technical skills and
inclusivity.

This guidance is designed to help you build and maintain an effective
mentoring relationship and support you through the mentoring process,
and ultimately move into your desired role.

## What is mentoring?

Mentoring is a professional partnership in which an experienced person
(the mentor) assists another (the mentee) in developing specific skills
and knowledge that will enhance the mentee’s professional and personal
growth and help develop their skills.

### The mentoring relationship

The purpose of the mentoring relationship is to:

-   Offer the mentee support and guidance, and help them to feel part of
    the Astropy community

-   Upskill the mentee in the mentor’s maintainer role

-   Identify skill / knowledge / behavioural gaps

-   Establish goals and action plans to meet these gaps

-   Assess progress and evaluate whether mentees are ready to progress
    to maintainer

### What is my role?

Your role as a mentee is to manage the relationship with your mentor –
as this is about your development, you need to own it. Identify your
strengths and development areas specific to the role you would like to
take on, and share this with your mentor to help them guide you in the
most effective way. You will need to be clear about what you want from
your mentoring and be open and candid about the support you need.

Effective mentees:

-   Are willing to discuss failures and successes

-   Have a desire to learn & develop - identify and share their
    development goals

-   Give and receive honest feedback

-   Are accountable and reliable

-   Are respectful of the mentor’s time

-   Communicate regularly

-   Take advantage of opportunities

Key points to remember:

-   Think about - what do you want to develop & focus on? Select and
    bring ideas for discussion to your meetings.

-   Ensure you keep appointments – ensure there is mutual respect for
    each other’s time.

-   It’s a two-way relationship. The mentor is here to guide you but
    will also be open to new ideas or ways of thinking – you may have an
    idea they’ve not considered before. Offer challenge and feedback to
    your mentor as well as receiving it.

### What should I expect from my mentor?

Effective mentors:

-   Help the mentee think through their options and provide advice and
    guidance

-   Encourage and motivate

-   Role model behaviours

-   Nurture – be open and candid, enabling the mentee to confide in and
    trust them

-   Maximise learning opportunities

-   Create an environment of mutual respect

-   Listen, challenge and provide feedback

-   Communicate regularly

## The mentoring process

![Process Flowchart](./mentoring_process_flowchart.png)

Successful applicants to the mentoring program will be paired with a suitable
mentor (when possible) by the mentoring coordinator. Current members of the
Astropy team may also identify potential mentees they would like to train in
their role and encourage them to apply. Mentees will apply for the program by
opening an issue on the astropy-mentoring repo, and the chosen mentor will be
assigned to that issue.

Once paired, the mentor and mentee will both be sent guidance and
recommendations - including this documentation - by the mentoring coordinator.
The mentor will then be responsible for holding regular meetings with the
mentee, and for guiding and supporting them appropriately throughout the
mentoring process. This is all described in more detail on the
[main page](index.md).

During meetings the mentor should discuss with the mentee what they want to
achieve from the program and where their current skills or behaviours fall short
of that aim. For instance, the mentee might wish to become a sub-package
maintainer but lack experience with that particular sub-package (skill/knowledge
gap), or have a poor record of reviewing PRs (behavioural gap). Once identified,
the mentor and mentee should agree an action plan to address these gaps (see
"Build an action plan" below). In each meeting the mentee's progress should be
assessed, any new aims and gaps should be discussed and a new action plan should
be agreed if necessary.

Both the mentor and mentee will be prompted to check in with the mentoring
coordinator monthly, to ensure that there are no issues requiring their
attention. Additionally, every three months the mentor will be asked to decide
whether the mentee has progressed enough to graduate to their chosen role or if
they should continue with the mentoring program. These check-ins will use the
mentee's application issue. If the mentee is ready to graduate, the mentor
should nominate them for the role following the usual process.
