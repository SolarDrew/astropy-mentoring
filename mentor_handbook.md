# Mentor Handbook

## The Astropy Mentoring Programme

The mentoring programme is designed to upskill potential candidates to
take on maintainer and other formal roles, as well as offering support
and guidance longer term. It is also designed to help improve and grow
the Astropy community -- both in terms of technical skills and
inclusivity.

This guidance is designed to help you build and maintain an effective
mentoring relationship and support you through the mentoring process.

## What is mentoring?

Mentoring is a professional partnership in which an experienced person
(the mentor) assists another (the mentee) in developing specific skills
and knowledge that will enhance the mentee's professional and personal
growth and help develop their skills.

### The mentoring relationship

The purpose of the mentoring relationship is to:

-   Offer the mentee support and guidance, and help them to feel part of
    the Astropy community

-   Upskill the mentee to take on the desired role

-   Identify skill / knowledge / behavioural gaps

-   Establish goals and action plans to meet these gaps

-   Assess progress and evaluate whether mentees are ready to take on the role

### What is my role?

Your role as a mentor is to offer guidance, advice, and support to your
mentee; to encourage and motivate them and to ensure your mentee has the
experience and confidence to take on more responsibility in the Astropy project.

Effective mentors:

-   Help the mentee think through their options and provide advice and
    guidance

-   Encourage and motivate

-   Role model behaviours

-   Nurture -- be open and candid, enabling the mentee to confide in and
    trust you

-   Maximise learning opportunities - and be patient!

-   Create an environment of mutual respect

-   Listen, challenge and provide feedback

-   Communicate regularly

Key points to remember:

-   Remember to ask - what do they want to develop & focus on? You are
    not there to fix problems for them, tell them what to do or discount
    their thoughts and opinions.

-   Patience is key -- push them out of their comfort zone gradually by
    offering challenge, but do not expect overnight changes. Avoid
    pushing too far, too soon.

-   Ensure you keep appointments -- ensure there is mutual respect for
    each other's time.

-   It's a two-way relationship. You are there to guide the mentee, but
    also be open to new ideas or ways of thinking -- your mentee may
    have an idea you've not considered before. Accept challenge and
    feedback from your mentee as well as offering it to them.

### What should I expect from my mentee?

Effective mentees:

-   Are willing to discuss failures and successes

-   Have a desire to learn & develop - identify and share their
    development goals

-   Give and receive honest feedback

-   Are accountable and reliable

-   Are respectful of your time

-   Communicate regularly

-   Take advantage of opportunities

### The first meeting

*Conversation guide*

To build a strong foundation for a mentoring relationship, it is
critical to build trust and clearly establish expectations at the
beginning. Use the following questions to guide your first mentoring
conversation, which will help you get to know one another and establish
mutual expectations and goals.

Consider where they are now, and where they are trying to get to -- the
specific skills, knowledge and behaviours they will need to take on
their aspired role.

**Background**

- What is your background?

- What are your greatest strengths and development areas?

- What are your short-term goals?  Long-term goals?

**Expectations**

- What topics would you like to cover to help you feel confident in this role?

- What specific skills or knowledge would you like to cover in our meetings?

- How do you prefer to communicate between meetings?

- What role do you expect your mentor to play?

- Are there any ground rules you would like to set?

### Establish the relationship timeline

To build an effective mentoring relationship and help them take on the
role, you should establish clear goals, build trust, define an action
plan, and then meet on a consistent basis. Use the check list below to
help.

### Build an action plan

Together, mentor and mentee should create an action plan to achieve the
objectives that the mentee established at the beginning of the
relationship. The mentor should help the mentee determine where to focus
and how best to accomplish their goals. Suggestion is to complete the
form below during your second meeting, and continuously update it, as
needed.

| Goals  | Mentee’s Action Steps | Mentor’s Action Steps | Support Network’s Action Steps (Role of manager, peers, etc.) | Potential Barriers (Risk mitigation steps) | Success Measures (Must be measurable and results-focused) | Target Completion Date(s) |

| **#2** |                       |                       |                                                               |                                            |                                                           |                           |
| **#3** |                       |                       |                                                               |                                            |                                                           |                           |

## In case of problems

Occasionally the mentee may need to exit the mentoring scheme without 'graduating',
or the mentor may no longer be able to continue working with the mentee. Either might
happen for a variety of reasons - time constraints, breakdown of the mentor/mentee
relationship, etc. If this is the case, the mentor should contact the mentoring
coordinator and explain the situation. The mentoring coordinator will then take
the appropriate action depending on the circumstances.
